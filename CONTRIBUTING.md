### Contributing to the Code

The source files can be found in `./src`. As you work, and/or when you're done, run
`npm test` to run the unit tests.

Once you're done, go ahead and open a Pull Request.

> :information_desk_person: Don't sweat it if you can't get the tests to pass,
or if you can't finish the changes you'd like to make. If you still open up a
Pull Request, we'll make sure it gets figured out.

### One More Thing...

Thanks again!
